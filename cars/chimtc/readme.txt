Performance and beauty have joined forces to concieve the Chimera Touring Car, a blistering fast race engineered super car, designed for almost any track you can throw at it. While it's not as fast as some pros, it is one of the most maneuverable. You can be lulled into a trance by this car's buttery smooth handling, without realizing you've walked all over the opposition. 

Anyways thank you for downloading, and I hope you have fun with this car!
