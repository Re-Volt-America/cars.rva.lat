When boasting a sleek body, powerful nitro guzzling engine, great acceleration, and 8 wheel drive, and the mass of a monster truck, who says you need to sacrifice strength for speed? That being said, having 4 more wheels than the rest of your rivals has its downsides. You will have trouble taking sharp turns at low speeds, and getting air is another thing to look out for, as you can get easly get shaken and lose control when landing, if not careful.

Fun fact: this car was inspired by the Nikko Porsche 956, with the main gimmick being inspired by a video titled "Cursed Gran Turismo Images"
