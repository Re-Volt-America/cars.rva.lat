Description             : A McLaren F1 GTR, a car requested by many.
  			  This zipfile comes with four versions of my
 			  McLaren F1 GTR.  The only difference between
 			  the four is that they have different paint
 			  jobs.  It goes about 43mph, with great
     	                  accelleration and handling.  Also, have a
 			  look at the disc brakes on the wheels.

Installation Info	: When you unzip this file, make sure it is to
 			  your revolt directory (eg.  c:\revolt)  Also
 			  have USE FOLDER NAMES ticked.  It will
  			  automatically unzip the four cars to their
 			  own directories. 

Other info              : The way I have set out this car makes it very
 			  easy to paint.  If you have a high quality
 			  paint job that looks good on the McLaren,
 			  email it to me and I might add it to this
 			  zipfile.  If you do wish to modify the car,
 			  please read the disclaimer at the bottom of
 			  this file.

Additional Credits to   : Ali and all the people who helped him 
                          with RVTMOD4, without it this car wouldn't be
 			  possible.  Thanks to all the guys at 
			  racerspoint who have waited for this car
 			  FOREVER!
