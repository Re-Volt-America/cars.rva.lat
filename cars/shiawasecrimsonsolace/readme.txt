Description             : 

the crimson-dyed cherry blossom trucker

Shiawase is a recreation of SnowCar from "Trackmania" racing game series.
this car is an onroad snow truck adorned with a crimson-dyed cherry blossom visuals.

as the car it was based on, Shiawase has very quirky handling.
compared to other Rookie cars, Shiawase is severaly underpowered with very slow acceleration and limited power.
the disadvantages is compensated with extremely good cornering radius 
and very high weight, but it is still not enough to make up for the downsides.

in order to win races, Shiawase relies on mantaining momentum.
its very high weight and very tight cornering allows for maintaining speed across corners without losing too much speed
the car especially gains an advantage whenever there is a steep downhill. 
a steep enough downhill may even allow speeds higher than a Pro car and keep the speed.

in short, improvising creatives racing lines by taking account of 
tight cornering ability and downhills is the way to remain competitive in races
