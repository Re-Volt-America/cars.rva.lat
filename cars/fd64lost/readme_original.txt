Car Name:                  MiniCooper

Install Directory:         Re-Volt\Cars\MiniCooper

Author:                    Randy

Car Description:           My first car for Re-Volt. Modelled after the older, original,
                           English made Mini Coopers. I used the origianl Re-Volt car 
                           'Sprinter' as the basis. Made the mesh, painted the skin, 
                           re-sized the .hul file, and only slightly changed the
                           parameters. If you look closely, you will notice it still has
                           the Sprinter's wheels.

Class:                     Rookie

Engine:                    Electric

Software Used:             MS Paint, Z-Modeller, TMVfR, rvminis5, rv-sizer, hullscale,
                           and PSP 8.

Other Notes:               The mesh has a few 'gaps' in the polys. First attempt at
                           creating a car. First time ever using Z-modeller, PSP 8, and
                           all the Re-Volt specific software. Should have spent more time
                           on it, but I started to get bored with it. Wanted to add 
                           bumpers, mirrors, and other details to it, but reminded myself
                           that it's just a r/c car, and all my r/c cars had simple
                           Lexan bodies that I painted.
