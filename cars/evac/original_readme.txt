Car information
================================================================
Car name        	: Stock Remodels pack #1

Car Type  		: remodel

Rating/Class   		: Covers the rest of classes/All rounder

Installed folder       	: ...\cars\bigvolt OR beatall 1/2/3/4

Description           	: A challenge that i've made for myself, remodel
			  the stocks, any classes, probably low tiers,
			  remodel the assets WITHOUT adding extra PRMs
			  (if the car doesn't have spinner, springs, axles
			  then i will only remodel the body and the wheels)
			  and WITHOUT changing the stock livery of the car
			  , which is a pretty cheap trick.

			  i will make a proper repaintable mapping later,
			  because some demand a proper repaintable mapping
			  which i'm glad everyone liking these gems so far.
			  no it won't take months, maybe weeks, i'm still
			  remodeling other cars too. i wanna keep being
			  P R O D U C T I V E.

	\	if anyone wanna make a livery of one or two or all
======== >	of these creations, please do contact me on discord.
	/	or... revoltzone comments section of course :D
