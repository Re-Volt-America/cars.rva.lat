Thanks for downloading Deep Blue! I hope you
like it~

After the massive succes of Toyvolt's Aquasonic,
competitors practically stumbled over each other
trying to push out a car to rival its status.
One thing they did not consider is that Aquasonic
is liked for its solid handling and good
performance for its class, not the aquatic
theme...

Deep blue is unlocked after beating the Bronze
cup.
