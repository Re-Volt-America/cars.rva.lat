Description             : This ain't a car that exists in reality.
But hey, isn't it cool anyway? Ferrari-stylish red and cool handling
and speed. It's not a Super-Pro as you would expect from its looks,
but it's fast enuff to kick all (nearly) of its opponents. Tuff AI
make this a good enemy to drive against, as well.
