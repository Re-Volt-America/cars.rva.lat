Car: Hammerhead
Class: Glow/Nitro
Rating: Advanced
Trans: RWD
Top Speed: 36MPH
Accel: OK
Handling: OK
Mass: 1.85kg

Despite boasting a higher than average top speed for the class, this muscle car can be considered a weak contender for the class. However, what it lacks in track performance it makes up for in durability and reliability. Rarely does Hammerhead spin out or be affected by harsh terrain, despite being rear wheel drive. These traits make this car forgiving for beginners and a nice challenge for the pros at the same time.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this car, and thanks for downloading!
